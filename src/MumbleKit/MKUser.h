/// MKUser represents a user on a Mumble server. A user always resides in a channel, which is
///represented by the MKChannel object. MKChannel objects are owned by their respective MKServerModel
/// instances.
///
/// The object's MKServerModel may change properties of the user at any time, but
/// all changes are serialized to the main thread. 
///
/// Generally, as a consumer of this API, most accesses to MKUser happen in response to
/// MKServerModelDelegate callbacks, and all calls to delegate methods of MKServerModel are
/// ensured to happen on the same thread that modifies MKChannle objects.
/// 
/// Thus, if all inspection of the MKChannel's properties happen in response to
/// MKServerModelDelegate callbacks, everything should be OK.
